/**
 * The domain event bus.
 *
 * Publishing is fire-and-forget from the caller's point of view, but events are
 * written to an outbox in the same transaction as the state change they
 * describe and relayed from there. That is what stops the classic marketplace
 * bug where a gig goes live and nobody is notified because the broker was
 * briefly unreachable.
 *
 * Topics are the Kafka topics in the architecture diagram; the in-memory bus
 * below implements the same contract for tests and local runs.
